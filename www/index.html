		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>So you might be using <a href="http://gc-dialer.garage.maemo.org">Dialcentral</a> and be thinking "the chat system is horrible and I want to use my system's contacts.  Why can't it be integrated with my phone software like Skype?
		</p>
		<p>You are in luck.  The One Ring is a way for you to integrate That One Number to Rule Them All.
		</p>
		<p>The One Ring let's you setup an account with the system similar to Google Talk, SIP, or Skype.  You can then use the same chat interface you use with GoogleTalk as you use to Text through GoogleVoice.  You also can initiate callbacks using the dialpad.
